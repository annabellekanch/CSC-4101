Project 2: Scheme Interpreter

Project 2 is meant to implement a scheme interpreter on top of the code from project 1. 
While much effort was put into creating a working interpreter, time constraints and lack of knowledge 
prevented us from getting our project to full functionality. We made great effort at trying to fix our scanner from project 1 
but we were not able to accomplish this. We also tried to implement the new functions that were added to project 2 and while we 
feel we did them correctly, the project itself will not scan properly and after much time debugging we were not able to figure out 
the solution. We came to the conclusion that our project is only missing a few minor details that is preventing it from working fully, 
and with more time we would be able to produce the scanner that was expected.
